# Laptop Knights
An HTML5/JavaScript game we are putting together as a hobby.
The game will be based off of the crazy pen-and-paper adventures
we have had as a gaming group. With characters designed as
representations of our typical play-style, and wacky worlds
to express the storytelling of the GMs in our group, our goal
with this game is not to produce an award winning AAA competing
title, but rather a game that we can enjoy as a group, and,
hopefully, anyone else who stumbles upon it.

It's still heavily a work-in-progress, and it may be years
before the project is completed (the game is a lower
priority than pretty much everything else).
